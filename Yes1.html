        <h1> Hihi I knew it!!🤗🤗💘</h1>
        <p>Alright!! Then see you on March 15, 2025! We're finally making that Batangas trip happen, the one we missed last December. Huhu, but at least I can finally make it up to you 😘😘.</p> 
        <p>For Valentine's Day, I’m still thinking about where to take you, bebu. I know you don’t like crowded places, so I want to find somewhere special just for us.</p> 
        <p>I actually tried booking Batangas for Feb 15, but the resort told me they’re fully booked for the entire month. </p>
        <p>I’m really sorry for the delay, but don’t worry I’ll make it up to you. Maybe with extra cuddles? 😏🤭❤️</p>
