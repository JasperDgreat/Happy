        <h2> I just wanna ask something🤭🥰</h2>
        <p> There’s this gorgeous, amazing person I’ve had my eye on for a while… and lucky me, she’s already mine. 😏 </p> 
        <p>I know she’s not the biggest fan of going out on Valentine’s Day because of the crowds, so I was thinking… Would you let me be the one to spend Valentine’s Day with you? </p>
        <p>I have a feeling it might get a little boring Valentines Day 😢, though, since the main plan I have for us isn’t really something we can do on Valentine’s day. But I do have something exciting in mind—wanna know what it is? 😏</p> 
        <p>You’ll find out if you say yes! HAHA. So, will you be my Valentine? I promise a day full of love, laughter, and maybe a few surprises (the good kind, of course 😏). What do you say, beautiful? </p>
